    "# Human Activity Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How data was recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial linear acceleration'(_tAcc-XYZ_) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (_tGyro-XYZ_) from Gyroscope with several variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "> prefix 't' in those metrics denotes time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> suffix 'XYZ' represents 3-axial signals in X , Y, and Z directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature names\n",
    "\n",
    "1. These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows(sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. From Each window, a feature vector was obtianed by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n",
    "> In our dataset, each datapoint represents a window with different readings \n",
    "3. The accelertion signal was saperated into Body and Gravity acceleration signals(___tBodyAcc-XYZ___ and ___tGravityAcc-XYZ___) using some low pass filter with corner frequecy of 0.3Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After that, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtian _jerk signals_ (___tBodyAccJerk-XYZ___ and ___tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ___). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names like _tBodyAccMag_, _tGravityAccMag_, _tBodyAccJerkMag_, _tBodyGyroMag_ and _tBodyGyroJerkMag_.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, We've got frequency domain signals from some of the available signals by applying a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). These signals obtained were labeled with ___prefix 'f'___ just like original signals with ___prefix 't'___. These signals are labeled as ___fBodyAcc-XYZ___, ___fBodyGyroMag___ etc.,.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. These are the signals that we got so far.\n",

    "\t+ ___entropy()___: Signal entropy\n",
    "\t+ ___arCoeff()___: Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4\n",
    "\t+ ___correlation()___: correlation coefficient between two signals\n",
    "\t+ ___maxInds()___: index of the frequency component with largest magnitude\n",
    "\t+ ___meanFreq()___: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency\n",

    "\t+ ___angle()___: Angle between to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
